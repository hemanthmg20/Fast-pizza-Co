# üçï Fast React Pizza Co.

Welcome to **Fast React Pizza Co.**, a simple and stylish pizza menu built using **React**! This is my first React project where I practiced building reusable components, managing props, and creating a responsive UI.

## üß© Features

- Component-based architecture (`Header`, `Menu`, `Pizza`, `Footer`)
- Dynamic data rendering using props
- Conditional rendering for sold-out items and opening hours
- Responsive and accessible UI
- Modular and maintainable CSS styling
